h1. Grbl - An embedded g-code interpreter and motion-controller for the Arduino/AVR328 microcontroller

h2. The goal: A no-compromise, high performance, low cost alternative to parallel-port based motion control for CNC milling

h2. Status:

* Ready for production, used regularly for countless CNC jobs
* Highly optimized C utilizing the hardware-timers of the AVR-chip for all critical timing
* Able to maintain more than 30kHz step rate, generating an ultra clean, jitter free step-signal
* Robust G-code interpreter, tested with output from several CAM tools
* Standards-compliant g-code arcs/circles fully supported
* Buffered, non blocking, asynchronous step generation so the rest of the system is free to process
  g-code while the steppers are steppin'
* Configuration parameters stored in EEPROM and set via simple commands
* Full acceleration management with look-ahead
** Smooth acceleration and deceleration lets stepper motors run at higher nominal speeds
** Smooth cornering within the set jerk-limit of your choosing will brake for sharp turns, but keep speed at slight direction changes                                                                                                                                    

Prioritized to-do:
* Backlash compensation
* Autodetect baud rate
* Spindle control
* Arduino IDE compatible (build and flash)
* Support "headless" fabrication by buffering all code to SD-card or similar

The project was initially inspired by the Arduino GCode Interpreter by Mike Ellery
