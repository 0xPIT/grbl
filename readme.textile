h1. Grbl - An embedded g-code interpreter and motion-controller for the Arduino/AVR328 microcontroller
    
Grbl is a no-compromise, high performance, low cost alternative to parallel-port-based motion control for CNC milling. It will run on a vanilla Arduino (Duemillanove/Uno) as long as it sports an Atmega 328. 

The controller is written in highly optimized C utilizing every clever feature of the AVR-chips to achieve precise timing and asynchronous operation. It is able to maintain more than 30kHz of stable, jitter free control pulses.

It accepts standards-compliant G-code and has been tested with the output of several CAM tools with no problems. Arcs, circles and helical motion are fully supported - but no support for tool offsets, functions or variables as these are apocryphal and fell into disuse after humans left G-code authoring to machines some time in the 80s.

Grbl includes full acceleration management with look ahead. That means the controller will look up to 20 motions into the future and plan its velocities ahead to deliver smooth acceleration and jerk-free cornering.

h2. Prioritized to-do:

* Backlash compensation
* Autodetect baud rate
* Spindle control
* Arduino IDE compatible (build and flash)
* Support "headless" fabrication by buffering all code to SD-card or similar

_The project was initially inspired by the Arduino GCode Interpreter by Mike Ellery_
